# On Unix platforms the OpenSSH Agent protocol is always enabled, but gpg-agent
# will only set the SSH_AUTH_SOCK variable if the option enable-ssh-support is
# given. Some Linux distributions use the presence of this option to decide
# whether the old ssh-agent shall be started.
#
# In this mode of operation, the agent does not only implement the gpg-agent
# protocol, but also the agent protocol used by OpenSSH (through a separate
# socket or via Named Pipes). Consequently, this allows one to use the
# gpg-agent as a drop-in replacement for the ssh-agent.
#
# SSH keys, which are to be used through the agent, need to be added to the
# gpg-agent initially through the ssh-add utility. When a key is added,
# ssh-add will ask for the password of the provided key file and send the
# unprotected key material to the agent; this causes the gpg-agent to ask for a
# passphrase, which is to be used for encrypting the newly received key and
# storing it in a gpg-agent specific directory.
#
# Once a key has been added to the gpg-agent this way, the gpg-agent will be
# ready to use the key.
#
# Note: in case the gpg-agent receives a signature request, the user might need
# to be prompted for a passphrase, which is necessary for decrypting the stored
# key. Since the ssh-agent protocol does not contain a mechanism for telling
# the agent on which display/terminal it is running, gpg-agent’s ssh-support
# will use the TTY or X display where gpg-agent has been started. To switch
# this display to the current one, the following command may be used:
#
#     gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye
#
# Although all GnuPG components try to start the gpg-agent as needed, this is
# not possible for the ssh support because ssh does not know about it. Thus if
# no GnuPG tool which accesses the agent has been run, there is no guarantee
# that ssh is able to use gpg-agent for authentication. To fix this you may
# start gpg-agent if needed using this simple command:
#
#    gpg-connect-agent /bye
#
# Adding the --verbose shows the progress of starting the agent.
#
# The order in which keys are presented to ssh are:
#
# Negative Use-for-ssh values
#   If a key file has the attribute "Use-for-ssh" and its value is negative,
#   these keys are presented first to ssh. The negative values are capped at
#   -999 with -999 being lower ranked than -1. These values can be used to
#   prefer on-disk keys over keys taken from active cards.
#
# Active cards
#   Active cards (inserted into a card reader or plugged in tokens) are always
#   tried; they are ordered by their serial numbers.
#
# Keys listed in the sshcontrol file
#   Non-disabled keys from the sshcontrol file are presented in the order they
#   appear in this file. Note that the sshcontrol file is deprecated.
#
# Positive Use-for-ssh values
#   If a key file has the attribute "Use-for-ssh" and its value is "yes",
#   "true", or any positive number the key is presented in the order of their
#   values. "yes" and "true" have a value of 1; other values are capped at
#   99999.
#
# Editing the "Use-for-ssh" values can be done with an editor or using
# gpg-connect-agent and "KEYATTR" (Remember to append a colon to the key; i.e.,
# use "Use-for-ssh:").
