# implementations do not, then some users will not be able to use the key
# signatures you make, or quite possibly your entire key. Note also that a
# public key algorithm must be compatible with the specified digest algorithm;
# thus selecting an arbitrary digest algorithm may result in error messages
# from lower crypto layers or lead to security flaws.

# Use string as a comment string in cleartext signatures and ASCII armored

# length of a single comment below 60 characters to avoid problems with mail
# programs wrapping such lines. Note that comment lines, like all other header

# Do not put the recipient key IDs into encrypted messages. This helps to hide
